Description: The obstacle detector is capable of detecting obstacles that are near it and can alert the user if the obstacles get close. It can also display the distance between the obstacle and itself in metres if it is present with the range of 99m. 

Components: Arduino UNO R3 Plus, Buzzer, Seven-segment display, Ultrasonic sensor, Resistors and Connecting wires.

Files:

obstacle-detector.ino - This file contains the code for all the devices that have been assembled with the Arduino. It has to be uploaded to the Arduino board and the pins have to be connected according to the code.
